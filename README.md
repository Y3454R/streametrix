# Streametrix

I have planned to create a frame extraction from stream (RTSP/RTMP) benchmarking tool. I think, it's a chance to use Python as `glue-script` as it was intended to become.<br>
Here, for the first phase I built a small utility to stream video files over RTSP using MediaMTX and FFmpeg. This script currently handles MediaMTX server startup and streams video content via RTSP protocol. <br>
My goal is to create a benchmarking tool for ffmpeg-based processes.
